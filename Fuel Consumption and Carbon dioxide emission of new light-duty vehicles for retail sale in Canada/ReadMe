In this Project, we learn how to use scikit-learn to implement simple linear regression.

1)We download a dataset that is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars.
2)We split our data into training and test sets.
3)Create a model using training set.
4)Evaluate your model using test set.
5)Finally we use model to predict unknown value.
